# Bugs
1. Buttons -> "Done" buttons don't work
2. Buttons -> Sometimes the buttons say pay now when the todo is nothing to do with payment.
3. Smarter analysis of todos and events with the example of the Volcano homework todo and the event of the date to take it to school.
4. Recurring events need attention, Ella's pe kit reminder has not been recurring in the diary. I think it only when in once.
5. impersonate doesn't work properly in prod, shows todos and events, but not email analysis and stored emails.
6. multiple env files doesn't appear to work fully when deploying (still looks at .env not .env.production)
7. when a todo contains something that needs to be packed or brought to school on a certain day or date, then an extra event should be created (single or recurring). - Done / NEEDS WORK
8. Attachment reading fails.
9. Send Summary email not working & also daily briefing didn't send this morning.

# New Features
1. Linked todos and events -> i may complete the volcano homework, but also need to remember which day to bring it to school, for example.
2. More detail - Document links - render documents on a link for further reading. 1 click from the email.
3. Capture WhatsApp group messages.
4. Proper onboarding.
5. Reading text from images.

# Ideas
1. Detection on dates passed being irrelevant, auto remove todos and events that are in the past from todos and events but leave them in the Calendar, they can just be marked as "done" and therefore wont need to appear in the list or email anymore.
2. Detect emergency emails?
