# Improve Admin tools

1. Roles and Permissions
    Make two roles: STANDARD (default for all users), ADMIN & SUPER_ADMIN
2. Give my account: tobystafford.assistant@gmail.com all three roles access, give all other accounts STANDARD access. 
3. Admin - Move all the dashboard tools to an admin area only accessible with ADMIN permission.
4. Make a settings page, which gives access to the settings route and the child profile areas. accessible to standard users and above.
5. For SUPER_ADMIN only, give extra controls to mimic all other users and roles (selected from a dropdown) this will enable debugging of users issues.
