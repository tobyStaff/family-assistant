The Spring term is now well underway and  we have continued to be busy in school.  We have spent a good chunk of this morn-  ing planting our new fabulous trees and  hedge whips on the playing field.   A huge  thank you to all the parents/carers who  gave up their time to help us — and to the children for all  their hard work digging! We look forward to watching the  trees and hedges grow. Fun fact: apparently voles are  particularly partial to gnawing on saplings, and they are  the biggest threat to our baby hedgerow.  Over the last two weeks we have also had the brilliant  Rainbow Theatre back in school, a year 5 trip to Rod-  borough and a Robotics Competition   -   more on these be-  low.   The booking link for our upcoming parents evenings  also went live this week, so if you still haven ’ t booked  your slot, please do so. We look forward to seeing lots of  you soon.  Rodborough trip  The Year 5 children took a trip to Rodborough school last  Thursday. The head of computing, Mr Toombs, began by  teaching the students to programme their micro:bits to  play a game of rock, paper scissors against the computer.  Later on, they used ring:bits to code small cars and tried  to move them backwards and forwards. It was insightful  and fun learning.  Inset Days for 2026/27 (To be approved by our Govern-  ing Board in February)  Inset days for the next academic year will be as follows:  Tuesday 1st September; Monday 2nd November; Friday  12th February 2027; Monday 12th April and Friday 28th  May. These dates are in line with the majority of GLP  schools, with joint staff training being held on some of the  dates. Our Governing Board will officially approve the  dates at their meeting in February, but we are not  anticipating any changes.  Save the Date — Music Works Concert  On Friday 20th March, Music Works will be holding a con-  cert in the school hall to showcase the talents of their  Busbridge Junior students! An invite will be sent out near-  er the time. We will initially invite only the parents of the  performers as space is very tight at this event.

The school hall was full of excitement and buzz, as the children  brought to life everything they had learnt in their History lessons. They also especially loved the impromptu Ro-  man battle on the playground at break time! It was an excellent day.  Year 4 Vikings Day  Hot on the heels of our Roman workshop, the Rainbow Theatre Company led a Viking workshop for Year 4. The  children learnt that the Vikings were always after more land and had a great time acting out scenes and learning  all about the Viking way of life. They then had a big decision to make — did they want to become Vikings them-  selves!   All the children looked amazing in their costumes. Thank you to all the parents for pulling their outfits  together.  Vex Robotics Competition at Charterhouse School  Recently, 11 of our Year 5 and 6s went to Charterhouse School to take part in the Vex Robotics competition,  where they put their robot programming skills to the test in a series of tournaments against other schools.  Having spent the last 4 months building their robots, this was a celebration of the huge amount of hard work and  effort that they put in. Not only did they show great respect, resilience and teamwork in the robotics element of  the competition, but they also had to design a conceptual robot to help the elderly for which they received a spe-  cial mention from the judges for their ingenuity! One of our teams came second in the robot tournament. It was  a fantastic day   -   a huge well done to all of the children involved, and a big Thank You to Mr Stuart for running the  club and preparing them for the big day. Champion!

Headteacher  Mr Richard   Catchpole BSc (Hons) PGCE NPQH  Friday   30 th   January 2026  Dear Parents / C arers  Animaltastic   –   child - led learning   -   9 th   to 1 2 th   February 202 6  This letter contains   informat ion regarding our   Animaltastic learning week   in February . We would  appreciate your   help in supporting your child(ren) with this, as needed.  Last year we carried out a hugely successful   One World Week   which enabled our children to carry  out independent and child - led learning. As educators we saw great value in   that learning event, so  we are carrying out a similar week of learning in the week before half - term. This time we are  calling the week,   Animaltastic .  The children have discussed this in class and in assembly. They have been set homework by their  class te acher to help them collect information in readiness for the Animaltastic week. Thank you  for supporting them in helping to collect ideas and information that they can then use in school.  Animaltastic   will provide:  -   The opportunity to practice our 6Rs (Be haviours For Learning) as well as our   Transferrable  Skills (see below for a list of these).  -   An   opportunity for children to find out and share information about   animals   that   are   of interest  to them   (i f the child cannot select their own   animals   they can   use information provided   by the ir  class teacher ).  -   An   opportunity for children to engage in independent, self - l ed work. They will be given o ptions  about what work outcomes they   can produce, and they   will self - select an appropriate number  from thi s list (e.g. a quiz, a fact - file, annotated   diagram , poster, etc).  What   animal   information could be covered   by the children? Well, a nything of interes t to them :  mythical animals, pets, zoo animals, animal care, endangered animals, habitats, camouflage art   …  the list goes on.   They have discussed some options in class .

What help are we request ing from parents?  (i)   Help them decide   what animals, group of animals or animal - theme they would like to  focus on.  (ii)   Help   them to find information, pictures and resources that they can bring in to school.  They will then use this information in class. This will also be part of their homework.  (iii)   If your child is going to make a model or 3D piece (for example using a shoe box) th ey  will need to source these things at home and bring them into school.  As the whole school is conducting this project at the same time we cannot guarantee access to the  internet at school, hence research at home will be very important.  Thank you for your help and support at home to hel ping us ensure that Animaltastic is   an   effective  and enjoyable   learning activity for your child(ren).  Kind regards  Richard Catchpole  6Rs (Behaviours For Learning) &   Transferrable Skills   –   a Busbridge CE Junior School initiative  At BJS we teach   specific curriculum knowledge and cur riculum   skills , as per the National Curriculum.  We also teach children how to learn through our 6Rs :   our   6 Behaviours For Learning ( showing   Respect ,  being   Ready   to learn,   and being   Responsible ,   Resilient ,   Re sourceful ,   Reflective   learners .  Along   with the above we also provide opportunities for children to develop what we refer to as  Transferrable Skills. These are broad skills that will enable them to be effective and successful across the  many areas of their life both now and in the future.

These are just some of the ways that the children can share their learning and   Animaltastic   information:  Interview   Drama   3D model  Instructions   Game   Puppet Show  Timeline   Story Map   Diagram  Poem   Quiz   Fact File  Acrostic   Photographs   Presentation  Brochure   List   Kidspiration  Painting   Poster   Song  Dance   Rap   Cartoon  Advert   / TV Show   Letter   Mind Map  and so on …. !
