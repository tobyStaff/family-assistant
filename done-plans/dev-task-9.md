# Improve email summary

1. Structure - separate the email into 2 parts:
    - Essential - (happening soon or an essential action to take)
    - For consideration - (happening not soon or containing optional, non-critical actions)
    - Still group items by child under these two sections if possible.
2. For todos and events appearing in the email, provide a button to instantly mark individual items as Complete (for todos) or Remove (for events).


Also additional item to fix:

- In some todos the action button containing a link always says "Pay now" even if its a link to fill in a form or some other action type.
