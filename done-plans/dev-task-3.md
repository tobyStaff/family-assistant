# Dev Task 3
## Enable easier testing of email analysis

1. On the emails analysis page, add a "Re-analyze" button to resend an individual email through the AI analysis pipeline again. Display the response when it is returned.
2. Make it possible to view the raw email content (open closed toggle to view and hide) making comparison easier between the raw input and the AI analysis.
