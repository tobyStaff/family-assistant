# Dev Task 4
## Make better use of child profiles to ignore irrelevant things.

1. The problem is shown by this example:

This is one of the Calendar events logged: 

Year 10 Parent Consultation Evening
✓ Synced
📅 Thu, 5 Feb 2026, 17:00
Parent consultation evening for Year 10 students.
📍 Rodborough
👶 General
🎯 90% confidence
☁️ Calendar ID: l2q2lh9aoff9...

And these are my 2 child profiles:

Amelie
Active
📚
7
🏫
Rodborough

--

Ella
Active
📚
5
🏫
Busbridge Junior

Clearly neither are in year 10 at Rodborough school. So the AI analysis must discard this email as noise. Its not of any interest.
