Notes on tweaks

- Buttons next to todos to mark as "done".
- Buttons next to events to mark as "done". - points to localhost

- If a document needs to be read by the parent / child, then provide a link directly to the document. Or you could just request a separate text summary of the document to scan in another email. "Request document summary"
- Add a way to easily forward on WhatsApps. maybe to a custom whatapp number so they can be picked up and added to todos etc.
- Enable reading of screenshot documents / homework etc from a whatsapp group.

- when a todo contains something that needs to be packed or brought to school on a certain day or date, then an extra event should be created (single or recurring). - Done / NEEDS WORK

1. The Insights section of the email - what does it achieve? It should really just summarise the things below:
    "Dress Ella in Pe Kit this morning"
    "Give Amelie a £1 for mufti before school"
    "Make sure Amelie brings her PE Kit back to school after the weekend"

2. Whatsapp number integration. Add to contacts, forward messages from the key group chat.
3. Onboarding will be important so that you can try to capture things from past emails that may be important. We've found the following recurring events or events that haven't passed yet. Would you like to add these? Finding Child info, with security statement. (we take personal data extremely seriously). We don't sell your data to a 3rd party. Enter name, class, school and interests/clubs: drama, guitar, badminton.
4. Admin role VS standard user role
    - Standard user -> use some settings, onboarding, child profiles.
    - Admin user -> All access.
    - Super Admin -> Account management & all access, with anonymised data (emails).
5. Detection on dates passed being irrelevant, auto remove todos and events that are in the past from todos and events but leave them in the Calendar, they can just be marked as "done" and therefore wont need to appear in the list or email anymore.


6. Detect emergency emails?
