Notes on tweaks

- Fix the pay now button appears in the wrong place.
- Separate things that are for consideration vs things that are essential.
- Buttons next to todos to mark as "done" / "not relevant".
- Buttons next to events to mark as "done" / "remove".

- If a document needs to be read by the parent / child, then provide a link directly to the document. Or you could just request a separate text summary of the document to scan in another email. "Request document summary"
- Add a way to easily forward on WhatsApps. maybe to a custom whatapp number so they can be picked up and added to todos etc.
- Enable reading of screenshot documents / homework etc from a whatsapp group.
