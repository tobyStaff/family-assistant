# Improve noise exclusion using the child profiles.  

Examples of events or todos incorrectly included or assigned to a Child.

1. Differentiate between an option and a compulsary events/item. 
In this example Boxercise club is an optional extra, so we shouldnt put it in the users diary. At this point it is merely an offer to consider, so all that is needed is a TODO to review/consider signing up for the After school Boxercise club. Not a payment todo (because that assumes the decision is made) and not the Events (also assumes the decision is made)

Todo:
💰 Payment £40.00
Pay £40 via Arbor for Boxercise Club sessions
