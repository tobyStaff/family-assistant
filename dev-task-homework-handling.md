# Homework handling

## Summary: improve the concept of handling homework todos and due dates.

- Add a new todo type of "HOMEWORK".
- Analysis should recognise Homework items as a special todo type and treat them accordingly.
- Sometimes multiple Homeworks will appear in one email each with their own task and due date.
- Homeworks need to be done ideally days in advance of the due date. So reminders for homework will need to be included up until the due date.
- Homeworks, as with other todos should be cleaned up (not appear in the email again) as soon as the datetime has passed.
