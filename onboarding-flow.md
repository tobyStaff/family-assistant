Onboarding flow

* Avoid duplicating functionality - first search for existing code that might be similar or the same before adding new code.

Changes to existing functionality

1. When first logging into the site, we want to remove the permission grants for now and make it so you are only creating your account with google as your identity & using for future logins. Users should no longer grant permissions at this stage.
    1a. Ensure that existing users and functionality are not affected by this change, they can carry-on as normal if they've already granted permissions.

New functionality
New onboarding flow

1. Welcome let's get your family assistant setup in 3 steps.
2. (1) To build your daily briefing, our AI needs to look for school signals. We do not read personal or financial emails. We only process senders you explicitly approve in the next step. Connect your gmail inbox with read permissions.
3. Connection flow. Then once connected, show success and invite user to scan inbox for school/family related emails.
4. (2) Scan Inbox - Show results 5 at a time (sender & subject line only) (up to a total of 20) and ask user to select yes/no to each email. Build up an include/exclude senders list that can later be managed in the settings page.
5. (3) Ask user to review the include/exclude list and adjust as needed. Confirm when ready.
6. Extracting key info - Run another inbox search for the selected senders/subjects for the last 30 days.
7. Display key info like Child profiles with schools & interests and year groups. Ask user to fill in the blanks/correct the profiles where needed. Confirm.
8. Setup almost complete! Click here to generate your first email. 
    - Send a first personalised email containing welcome message and daily briefing preview.

ISSUES
- Too many emails to sift through initially
- Risk of missing key emails? e.g Google classroom and sparks didnt show.
