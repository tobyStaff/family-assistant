This is the "Founding Member" landing page. In January 2026, high-end SaaS design has shifted toward **"Bento Box"** layouts—clean, modular blocks that visualize data and value.

The name **"Family AI Assistant"** is a functional working title, but to justify the **£19.99** price, we will style the copy to feel like a "Premium Executive Service."

## 🛠 Developer Spec: The "Family AI" Landing Page

### 1. Visual Identity & Styling

* **Theme:** "Serene & Structured" (Light Mode).
* **Colors:**
* **Background:** `#FAF9F6` (Alabaster/Warm Paper). Avoids the clinical feel of pure white.
* **Primary (Trust Blue):** `#2A5C82` (Deep Sea Blue). Evokes stability, authority, and calm.
* **Secondary (Sky):** `#E3F2FD`. Used for background blocks to keep the page feeling "airy."
* **Accent (Growth Green):** `#4CAF50`. Used sparingly for "Admin Saved" stats and "Success" states.


* **Typography:** **Fraunces** (Soft Serif) for headlines to feel "human" and "literary"; **Plus Jakarta Sans** for body text for modern legibility.
* **UI Style (2026 "Snug Simple"):** * **Radius:** Ultra-rounded corners (`24px+`) on all cards.
* **Shadows:** Very soft, large-spread "Ambient" shadows.
* **Tactility:** "Light Skeuomorphism"—buttons should look slightly raised and "clickable," not flat.

### 2. The Copy & Structure

#### **Section 1: Hero (The Hook)**

* **Headline:** Stop Reading School Emails. Start Being a Parent.
* **Sub-headline:** The fragmented mess of Arbor, WhatsApp groups, and 4 different email accounts—filtered into one 60-second daily briefing.
* **CTA Button:** [Get 1 of 10 Beta Slots] (Scrolls to pricing).
* **Social Proof:** "Currently saving founder-parents 3.5 hours of 'Admin Drift' per week."

#### **Section 2: The "Pain" Bento Grid**

* **Card A (The Inbox):** *Visual: A messy stack of email icons.* "4 Email Accounts. 12 School Apps. 0 Sanity."
* **Card B (The WhatsApp):** *Visual: A chat bubble with '142 unread'.* "We filter the 'Class Rep' noise to find the 1% that actually matters."
* **Card C (The Solution):** *Visual: A sleek mock-up of the 'Killer Email'.* "One Briefing. 7:00 AM. Everything you need to pack, pay, and sign."

## 3. Technical Implementation Instructions for AI Dev

**Prompt to provide the AI Developer:**

> "Build a high-conversion landing page.
> **Architecture:**
> 1. **Header:** Minimalist logo on left, 'Login' on right.
> 2. **Hero:** Centered text with a 'Glow' effect behind the main CTA.
> 3. **Bento Grid:** Create a 3-column grid for the 'Pain Points'.
> 4. **Pricing Table:** Build a 3-column responsive pricing table. Highlight the 'Mid' tier as 'Most Popular' with a cyan border.
> 5. **Forms:** Integrated waitlist signup using a simple email input that stores in the db.
> 
> 
> **Specific Component:** Create a 'Mock Email Briefing' component that scrolls into view. It should look like a dark-mode smartphone screen showing the 'Action-First' template we designed.

## 4. Your Groundwork "GTM" Task

While the developer builds this, your job is to secure your first 10.

1. **The "Scarcity" Post:** Post on LinkedIn: *"I am launching a private beta for a tool that automates school admin for busy parents. I am only taking 10 people for the first cohort to ensure the AI mapping is 100% accurate. Comment 'ADMIN' if you want the link to the Early Bird slot (£5.49/mo)."*
2. **The Direct Outreach:** DM the 3 people you know who have kids in different schools and complain about "the group chat." Tell them you have a **£5.49** slot for them if they act today.

**Would you like me to write the "Onboarding Survey" that these first 10 users will see after they pay?** It's crucial for gathering the "School Data" the AI needs to start parsing.
