- Extract attachments and add to email bodies.
- Run an initial analysis on email history to confirm how many children in different classes/schools/years there are. Give user option to configure a name. use placeholder in the meantime e.g: Busbridge Yr 5, Rodbourough Yr 7.

- Suggested Improvements to the UX
"Pack" vs. "Click" Separation: People usually "Pack" (physical tasks) at 7:00 PM or 7:00 AM, but they "Click" (forms/payments) during a coffee break or commute. Separating these helps them batch their efforts.

Time-to-Complete: Adding a tag like (2 mins) next to a form signature makes it more likely they’ll do it immediately.

The "Family Readiness" Score: A simple visual at the top (e.g., "80% Ready for Monday") acts as a dopamine hit when they clear the list.

I think your intuition is spot on. For a £20/month product, you aren't selling "information"—you are selling "Executive Function." Busy parents don't want to "read" about school; they want to know if they are "winning" or "losing" at the logistics for tomorrow. By moving the Action/To-Do section to the top and ordering it by urgency, you transform the email from a newsletter into a Mission Briefing.

WhatsApp Signal (Class 4B Group)

Parents are discussing a group gift for Mrs. H’s birthday. We will notify you once a collection link is posted.

Why this is an improvement:
Urgency Hierarchy: It answers the "What do I need to do now?" question in the first 3 seconds.

Cognitive Batching: It separates the "morning panic" items (PE kits) from the "admin" items (Forms/Payments).

The "Shopping" Integration: For a £20 user, telling them they need to buy something and giving them the link to a vetted Amazon product is a massive value-add.

Digest as "Optional": By labeling the last section "Informational Only," you give the user permission to skip it if they are overwhelmed, which reduces their overall stress.

Next Step for you
Would you like me to refine the AI Data Extraction prompt to specifically categorize items into "Physical (Pack)" vs "Digital (Pay/Sign)" to power this new layout?
